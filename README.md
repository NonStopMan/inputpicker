# jQuery UI Inputpicker

## Introduce
This is a jQuery UI input picker plugin built to match with other official jQuery UI widgets. It would blend nicely multiple columns view with your form. The plugin is very easy to integrate in your form for your inputs.

I built this plugin because I could not find a suitable plugin to support multiple columns in drop-down selection perfectly that what I needed for my projects.
